# VAE for Climate Data Imputation

This repository implements a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (ConvVAE) for imputing missing climate data from netCDF files.

ðŸš€ Features
Loads netCDF climate data and preprocesses it.

Corrupts data artificially to train the model on missing values.

Implements a ConvVAE for reconstructing the missing climate data.

Provides a training script for model optimization.
